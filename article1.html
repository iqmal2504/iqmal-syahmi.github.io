                        <p id="para2">Ultimate Frisbee, is a sport that involves tossing and passing plastic disc, which is called "frisbee". It can be played whether in football-sized field or indoor futsal court. The objective of the game is to score points until
                            reached score cap, or before game timer run out.</p>
                        <h2 id="heading2">The Rising of New Sport</h2>
                        <p>The origin of Ultimate Frisbee was began in 1967, where Joel Silver and his friends have an idea to introduce "ultimate" frisbee game to their school student council, which were Columbia High School (CHS), located in Maplewood,
                            New Jersey, U.S.A. Their first game of ultimate frisbee was played in 1968, which the school's newspaper staff team won against the school's student council team.<br><br>Over the next few years after the first Ultimate frisbee
                            match, various kind of rules and regulations were drawed up and established in order to made Ultimate Frisbee game interesting and at the same time safe for all.</p>

                        <p id="para3">1975 were the times which Ultimate Frisbee game spreaded across every part of U.S.A, then spreaded beyond boundaries which were Europe and Asia countries, specifically Sweden and Japan which they established their national Frisbee
                            association. This movements were next followed by Australia, Austria, Belgium, Finland, and Denmark by the end of 1978.&nbsp;</p>

                            Flying Disc Federation (WFDF) was established in 1984, to replace IFA which was closed a year prior. WFDF serves as international governing body of all disc sports, and WFDF membership as of for now extends to 100,000 members
                            in 30 different countries.</p>
